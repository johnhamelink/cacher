    A webhook allows you to receive certain events at a specified endpoint in our server upon which you can take certain actions.

    ### Configuring a webhook

    A webhook can be generated from the Bondio's portal by following these step:
    1. Go to the `webhooks` section on the side bar.
    2. Click on `New webhook` at the top right.
    3. Enter your server endpoint, where you want to receive the webhook events.
    4. Click `Create`


    ### All events
    The table below shows all the events that are sent from Bondio's platform to your server and their respective triggers. Click on the event type to find more about it. 
    event type | trigger
    ---------|------
     [subscription.activated](/docs/bondio-api/t5xav2o6vaghg-subscription-activated) | When the device successfully connects to a network in the coverage area of the plan for the first time. 
     [subscription.expired](/docs/bondio-api/0oxql620vkg89-subscription-expired) | When the validity of the subscription is expired and the mobile service no longer works.
     [subscription.allowance.thresholdBreached](/docs/bondio-api/80lmg6fcw25zt-subscription-allowance-threshold-breached) | When the subscription usage(data/voice/sms) breaches the 80%, 90% or 100% thresholds.
     [subscription.allowance.remaining](/docs/bondio-api/dyv77q84mtc8p-subscription-allowance-remaining) | When the remaining balance(data/voice/sms) reaches a specific value.

    ### Sample event
    ```json
    {
      "type": "subscription.allowance.thresholdBreached",
      "subscriptionId": "subs.xb1rt3j0",
      "breachedService": "data",
      "esimIccid": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX1234",
      "threshold": 80
    }
    ```

    ### Validate webhook signature

    Each webhook call generated from bondio will consist of a unique signature header to validate call authentication.
    The webhook will contain a header 'bondio-signature' which identifies call signature for each user uniquely.
    To validate the signature we have created a npm library https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bondio/webhook-signature-validator

    ```
    import * as bondioSignatureValidator from '@bondio/webhook-signature-validator';

    bondioSignatureValidator.validate(signature, signingKey, webhookDataObject);
    ```
    Field type | Description
    ---------|------
    signature | The header received in bondio-signature field.
    signingKey | The key defined while registering webhook url on https://dashboard.bondio.co/home/webhooks
    webhookDataObject | The json data received in webhook call.
